# **Strategic Plan: Austin Peay Solutions, Technology & Applied Research (STAR) Center**

**Proposed Timeframe:** Academic Year 2025-2026 to Academic Year 2029-2030

This strategic plan is formulated based on established best practices for successful university research centers and institutes. It recognizes that a clear mission aligned with university strategy, a sustainable financial model, a commitment to interdisciplinary collaboration, and robust systems for evaluation are critical for long-term success and impact.1 Crucially, this plan directly aligns the Center's mission and activities with the key performance indicators of the State of Tennessee's outcomes-based funding (OBF) model, framing the Center as a direct contributor to the university's financial health and strategic success.

### **1\. Executive Summary**

The Austin Peay State University (APSU) GIS Center stands at a strategic crossroads. Over more than two decades, it has evolved from a specialized mapping unit into a dynamic, interdisciplinary hub for applied technology, data intelligence, and community-focused problem-solving.2 This evolution has created a significant "perception debt"—a gap between the Center's public identity and its proven, expanded capabilities.2 The current name no longer represents the breadth of the Center's work, limiting its potential for growth, student engagement, and community impact.

This document outlines a five-year strategic plan to address this challenge by rebranding and realigning the Center as the **Austin Peay Solutions, Technology & Applied Research (STAR) Center**. This new identity accurately reflects the Center's core mission: a dual mandate to provide students with unparalleled, career-building experiential learning while delivering high-value, innovative solutions to community, government, and university partners.2 This student-centric, applied-research model directly supports the key drivers of the State of Tennessee's outcomes-based funding formula by enhancing student retention, progression, and post-graduation success, positioning the STAR Center as a direct contributor to the university's financial health and strategic goals.

The STAR Center will be positioned as a premier, interdisciplinary hub organized around key service pillars: Geospatial Intelligence, Data Science & Economic Analytics, Public Safety & Facility Resilience, and Applied Technology. The plan outlines four strategic goals focused on driving regional innovation, becoming a hub for talent development, advancing the university's research profile, and ensuring financial sustainability.

By executing this plan, the STAR Center will not only resolve its perception debt but will become a powerful strategic asset for the university. Expected outcomes include a significant increase in external contract revenue, an enhanced reputation for APSU as a leader in applied technology, a robust talent pipeline for high-demand jobs, and a deeper, more impactful partnership with the communities we serve.

### **2\. The Strategic Imperative: From GIS Center to STAR Center**

The transition from the GIS Center to the STAR Center is not merely a name change; it is a strategic realignment essential for future growth. The "perception debt" created by the current name is a significant liability.2 The term "GIS" implies map-making to a non-technical audience, which dramatically undersells the Center's demonstrated expertise in diverse and advanced technological domains.2 This communication challenge extends internally, creating a recurring need to explain the term and the Center's full scope to students, faculty, and university leadership, which can hinder interdisciplinary collaboration and recruitment.

The Center's project portfolio proves it has earned a new identity. This evolution is evidenced by landmark projects that go far beyond traditional mapping:

* **Interdisciplinary Data Analysis:** The 10-year agreement with Fort Campbell to conduct comprehensive economic impact studies, a collaboration with the APSU Department of Mathematics and Statistics, positions the Center as a high-level data intelligence unit.2  
* **Applied Technology and Prototyping:** The Center's leadership in 3D-printing face shields during the COVID-19 pandemic and its development of the APSU Robotics Camp showcase its capacity as a hands-on innovation hub.2  
* **Advanced Data Capture and Visualization:** The use of UAVs (drones) for rapid disaster response mapping, and the creation of 3D "digital twins" of facilities using BIM and 360-degree cameras, demonstrate capabilities in public safety and facility management that are critical to local governments.  
* **National-Level Aerospace and Healthcare Research:** The Center's role as a sub-awardee on a major NASA grant, the "Community Air Mobility for Public Utilization in Support of Healthcare (CAMPUS)" project, is a definitive statement of its advanced capabilities. This collaboration with Meharry Medical College involves developing and deploying a 3D-printed drone swarm, integrating advanced sensors, and creating an edge-cloud computing framework to revolutionize emergency healthcare delivery in Middle Tennessee. This project places the Center and its students at the forefront of national research in Advanced Air Mobility (AAM), a field far beyond the scope of a traditional GIS unit.13

A name that accurately reflects this broad expertise is necessary to attract the right partners, secure new opportunities, and recruit top student talent from diverse disciplines like computer science, mathematics, and business.2 The STAR Center brand is a confident declaration of this new reality, aligning the Center's identity with its proven record of success and its vision for the future.

2.3 Aligning with University Success and State Funding  
The most compelling reason for this strategic realignment is its direct connection to the financial health and strategic success of Austin Peay State University. The State of Tennessee's outcomes-based funding (OBF) formula is the primary driver of state appropriations, and it heavily rewards institutions for student success metrics such as degree completion and graduation rates. APSU has historically performed well under this model, and the STAR Center's operational framework is perfectly designed to amplify this success.  
Research consistently shows that undergraduate research and internship programs are high-impact practices that increase student retention, improve academic performance (GPA), and boost graduation rates. The STAR Center's model, which embeds students in every aspect of its applied research projects, is a powerful engine for delivering these exact outcomes. By providing students with paid, professional experience, the Center not only prepares them for the workforce but also keeps them engaged and on track toward graduation—directly impacting the university's performance on the most heavily weighted OBF metrics.

Furthermore, with the strong possibility that the state will add post-graduation employment to the funding formula in the future, the STAR Center's role becomes even more critical. The Center actively prepares students with job-ready skills and, through its deep community partnerships, creates a direct pipeline to employment with local and regional partners. This strategic plan, therefore, is not just about the future of a center; it is about positioning a key university asset to be a more powerful and quantifiable contributor to the university's most important strategic and financial goals.
