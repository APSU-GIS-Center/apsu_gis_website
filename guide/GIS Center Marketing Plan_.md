# **A Strategic Marketing and Engagement Plan for the Austin Peay State University GIS Center**

## **Executive Summary**

Local governments in the Austin Peay State University (APSU) service region are confronting escalating and legally mandated pressures related to infrastructure management, with a particular emphasis on stormwater compliance. These obligations, often coupled with constrained budgets and limited in-house technical expertise, create a distinct and persistent demand for cost-effective, expert Geographic Information Systems (GIS) services. The APSU GIS Center is uniquely positioned to address this market need, not by competing as a lower-cost alternative to private firms, but by establishing itself as a fundamentally different and more valuable strategic partner. The Center's identity as a credible, mission-driven university entity that can offer integrated educational opportunities, coupled with its proven, long-standing expertise in UAV data collection, Building Information Modeling (BIM), and rapid disaster response, presents a decisive competitive advantage.

This plan outlines a five-pronged, zero-budget marketing strategy to leverage the Center's strengths. The approach focuses on: 1\) **Foundational Asset Development**, which involves systematically creating a professional suite of marketing materials by collaborating with internal university resources; 2\) **Proactive Relationship-Based Outreach**, centered on directly engaging a prioritized list of key municipal decision-makers; 3\) an **Authority and Visibility Campaign** to establish the Center as the regional thought leader through targeted publications and conference presentations; and 4\) **The University Geospatial Advantage Initiative**, which uses the Center's academic role as a powerful "foot-in-the-door" business development tool; and 5\) leveraging specialized capabilities in **Economic Development and Public Safety** to open new, high-value service lines.

Successful execution of this plan is expected to yield a significant increase in the number of qualified leads, higher proposal submission rates, a more robust and predictable contract pipeline, and ultimately, a substantial and sustainable growth in revenue generated from municipal contracts. The Center will experience revenue increases and growth by elevating its visibility and positioning itself as the premier provider of specialized GIS solutions for local governments throughout its service area.

## **I. Analysis of the Regional Municipal Services Market: Needs, Pressures, and Opportunities**

An effective marketing strategy must deeply understand the target market's operational realities, regulatory pressures, and planning cycles. For local governments in the Clarksville region, a clear and non-discretionary need for advanced GIS services emerges from their responsibilities in infrastructure and, most critically, stormwater management.

### **A. The Pervasive Challenge of Infrastructure and Stormwater Management**

Municipalities across the region operate comprehensive public works departments responsible for a wide array of infrastructure, including streets, sanitation, and, explicitly, stormwater management.1 This responsibility is not optional. Federal mandates, most notably the Clean Water Act, and subsequent state-level permits like the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program, legally require municipalities to manage, monitor, and report on their stormwater systems. Regulations create a non-negotiable, recurring need for the APSU GIS Center's services, such as infrastructure mapping, outfall inventories, and data analysis for annual reports.

For example, the City of Springfield, TN details an extensive Public Works Storm Water Management program, including a formal Stormwater Management Ordinance, a system of user fees to fund its activities, and compliance with the federal NPDES Phase II program.1 Similarly, the City of Dickson operates as a Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) under a state-mandated NPDES permit, which requires a management program with six minimum control measures, including public education, illicit discharge detection, and construction site runoff control.2

The formation of local stormwater agencies indicates a fundamental evolution in how municipalities approach this issue. Stormwater is no longer viewed merely as a "problem" to be addressed after a flood; it has become a continuous "program" to be managed. The existence of the Hopkinsville Surface and Stormwater Utility (HSSU), created by ordinance in 2005 to address chronic flooding, further illustrates this point.4 The HSSU is funded by a dedicated monthly service fee levied on all real property within the city, enabling it to finance numerous large-scale flood control projects like retention basins.4 Montgomery County also maintains a formal Stormwater department and a detailed, multi-chapter Stormwater Management Program, signaling a codified, long-term commitment.6

This programmatic approach creates a market for ongoing support, not just one-off projects. It opens the door for the GIS Center to move from a model based on single data collection contracts to one built on recurring revenue through long-term service agreements. These agreements could cover annual data updates, support for compliance reporting, and modeling for future capital projects, providing a stable financial foundation for the Center.

### **B. The Budgetary and Planning Cycles of Local Government**

Local governments operate according to formal annual budgets and, for larger expenditures, multi-year Capital Improvement Plans (CIPs) that outline spending on significant projects.8 These documents are the blueprints for future spending and represent a critical intelligence source for proactive marketing. The GIS Center can identify planned projects by obtaining and analyzing these plans *before* a Request for Proposal (RFP) is issued.

For instance, Christian County, KY, recently passed a $52 million budget that allocates $4.5 million in carried-over funds for capital expenses, including renovations to the courthouse and animal shelter.9 Robertson County's FY2024 budget included specific appropriations for a Highway Fund and capital outlay.10 These line items represent concrete opportunities for GIS support.

Furthermore, long-range planning efforts signal future high-value GIS work. The City of Springfield recently invested $78,000 in a Comprehensive Growth Plan to guide policy and anticipate budgets for the next 20 years. While not a capital expenditure plan, it is designed to *guide* that document, meaning it will drive future infrastructure decisions.3 In Cheatham County, a major $30 million port project is being developed in partnership with the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT).12 Such a project will undoubtedly require extensive infrastructure mapping, logistical planning, and environmental impact analysis—all core competencies of the GIS Center.

To be truly effective, proposals must align with the strategic justification *behind* a project. A CIP may list *what* a county intends to purchase (e.g., "new drainage culverts"), but a comprehensive plan explains *why* (e.g., "to support projected residential growth"). The Cheatham County port project is not merely about building a dock; its strategic purpose is economic development and job creation.12 Therefore, the most compelling marketing message is not, "We can map your new port." It is, "Our GIS modeling can help optimize truck routes to the new port, minimizing traffic impact on local roads and demonstrating the positive economic ripple effect to stakeholders." This approach elevates the Center from a technical vendor to a strategic partner in achieving a county's core goals.

## **II. Competitive Positioning and Differentiators for the APSU GIS Center**

The regional market for GIS services is active and includes several sophisticated private-sector firms. This competition validates the demand but necessitates a clear and defensible market position for the APSU GIS Center. The Center's strategy should not be to imitate these firms but to highlight its unique institutional advantages.

### **A. The Private Sector Landscape**

Several well-established engineering and GIS consulting firms serve the Tennessee and Kentucky markets, representing the primary competition for municipal contracts.

* **True North Geographic Technologies:** Based in Murfreesboro, TN, True North is an Esri Gold Partner with deep experience in local government, public works, and utilities. They explicitly market services for migrating local governments to cloud-based GIS and offer ongoing managed services contracts.13 Their established relationships are significant; they were contracted by the state's Strategic Technology Solutions (STS-GIS) to help facilitate the NG 9-1-1 dataset with local emergency communication districts, a foundational public safety project.15  
* **Colliers Engineering & Design:** With offices in Nashville, Brentwood, and Knoxville, Colliers is a large, multi-disciplinary firm providing a comprehensive suite of services. Their offerings include a Survey/Geospatial division and a dedicated "Governmental" services practice that offers GIS Asset Management and Municipal Engineering.16 Their long-standing contract with Metro Nashville Public Works for managing its paving program with GIS demonstrates their capacity for large-scale municipal projects.18  
* **Civil & Environmental Consultants, Inc. (CEC):** Operating from Franklin, TN, CEC is another large firm with a dedicated Public Sector practice group.19 Their public bid list shows active engagement with smaller entities in the APSU service area, including the Cheatham County Water and Wastewater Authority and the Town of Kingston Springs, often on traditional civil engineering projects like sewer maintenance hole rehabilitation, where GIS was a component (GIS Center Project 2024).

The presence of these firms confirms a healthy market. However, the Center's competitive strategy must recognize its different operational model. Large firms like Colliers are focused on major metropolitan clients like Nashville. True North targets higher-tier enterprise solutions involving complex software integrations like Cityworks AMS.21 This creates a strategic opening for the APSU GIS Center to become the primary, expert GIS provider for the Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities and counties that need sophisticated GIS work but may not require a complete enterprise overhaul.

### **B. Defining the APSU GIS Center's Unique Value Proposition (UVP)**

The Center should build its marketing message around five pillars that private firms cannot replicate.

* **Pillar 1: Unimpeachable Credibility and Neutrality:** As a research and service center within Austin Peay State University, a respected state institution, the GIS Center operates with a different mission.22 Housed within the College of STEM, its purpose is driven by science and public service, not profit margins.23 The positioning statement should reflect this:  
  *"As a research and service center within Austin Peay State University, we provide objective, science-driven geospatial solutions. Our only mission is to deliver the best possible data and analysis to support effective public governance."* The statement contrasts sharply with private firms that may have sales quotas or incentives to upsell proprietary software and additional services.  
* **Pillar 2: The Academic Powerhouse and Workforce Development:** The Center is a hub of academic expertise. GIS professionals are staffed and directly linked to academic departments like Earth and Environmental Sciences (which offers a GIS minor) and Computer Science.22 This connection provides a unique value-add. The positioning statement should emphasize this multi-faceted approach:  
  *"We don't just complete your project; we integrate it into our academic mission. By partnering with us, you gain access to the latest research and provide invaluable real-world experience for the next generation of Tennessee's and Kentucky's workforce."* The statement transforms a simple contract into a community investment, a benefit no for-profit competitor can offer.  
* **Pillar 3: Cost-Effectiveness and Budget Maximization:** The Center's stated mission is to "provide small businesses and counties with the best value by maximizing any budget".22 Its operational structure, which can leverage student and graduate assistant labor under expert supervision, allows for a highly efficient cost model. The positioning statement should be direct:  
  *"Our unique structure as a university-based center allows us to deliver professional, high-quality GIS services in a highly cost-effective manner. We are structured to serve the public good, not to maximize profit, leveraging your taxpayer dollars with maximum efficiency."*  
* ***Pillar 4: Partner in Economic Growth and Strategic Planning:*** By leveraging powerful tools like Esri's Business Analyst, the Center can transcend traditional GIS services and become a vital partner in local economic development. The Center can provide sophisticated market intelligence, including demographic analysis, consumer spending habits, and business data, to help municipalities with business recruitment, retention, and expansion efforts. The positioning statement should highlight this advanced capability: "We are more than mappers; we are your strategic partners in community and economic development. Using advanced analytics, we provide the data-driven insights you need to attract new investment, support local businesses, and plan for a prosperous future."  
* **Pillar 5: Proven Partner in Public Safety and Resilience:** With extensive experience in UAV (drone) data collection and a history of assisting local communities with disaster mapping dating back to the 1999 Clarksville tornado, the Center offers a unique and critical service. This is not a theoretical capability but a proven, field-tested expertise in rapid response and damage assessment. Furthermore, with demonstrated experience in creating detailed 3D digital maps of facilities, the Center provides an essential service for pre-incident planning, preventive maintenance, and first responder safety. The positioning statement should emphasize this deep experience: *"When disaster strikes, we are not just a contractor; we are a community partner with over two decades of experience on the ground. From pre-incident 3D facility mapping that gives first responders a critical tactical advantage, to post-event UAV-based damage assessment, we provide the geospatial intelligence that emergency managers and public works directors need to respond effectively, accelerate recovery, and manage facilities more efficiently."*    
* 

## **III. Prioritized Target Audience Matrix**

With limited time and no marketing budget, a focused and systematic approach to outreach is essential. As Director and Chief Marketer, I need to focus on the jurisdictions with the highest probability of conversion. Focusing on probability requires moving beyond a simple list of nearby towns and creating a prioritized matrix based on demonstrable need and accessibility.

### **A. Tiered Target Jurisdiction List**

A tiered system allows for the most intensive and personalized outreach to Tier 1 targets, having the highest potential for generating revenue. The following table illustrates a prioritization framework. Jurisdictions are scored and tiered based on proximity to APSU, population size, documented evidence of need (e.g., active stormwater programs, capital projects), and whether a key decision-maker is identified.

| Jurisdiction Name | State | Proximity | Population | Evidence of Need | Decision-Maker ID? | Priority Tier |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Robertson County / City of Springfield** | TN | High | High | High (Stormwater Program 1, Growth Plan 11, Capital Budget 10) | Yes | **1** |
| **Christian County / City of Hopkinsville** | KY | High | High | High (Stormwater Utility 4, Capital Budget 9, Public Works Dept. 25) | Yes | **1** |
| **Dickson County / City of Dickson** | TN | Medium | Medium | High (Stormwater Program 2, Public Works Dept. 2) | Yes | **1** |
| **Stewart County / Dover** | TN | High | Low | Medium (Hwy Dept. 28, Public Utilities 29) | Yes | **2** |
| **Trigg County, KY** | KY | Medium | Low | Medium (Proximity to Lake Barkley 30) | No | **2** |
| **Houston County, TN** | TN | Medium | Low | Low (Traditional structure, fewer documented projects 31) | Yes | **3** |
| **Todd County, KY** | KY | Medium | Low | Low (Limited online presence for county govt. 32) | No | **3** |

### **B. Key Personnel Directory**

The prioritized list must be translated into an actionable outreach database. This directory will be the tactical foundation for the relationship-building campaign, tracking all interactions and ensuring systematic follow-up. Key personnel to target include County Mayors/Executives, Public Works Directors, City Engineers, City Managers/Administrators, Stormwater Program Managers, Emergency Management Agency (EMA) Directors, and School Superintendents. Contact information for many of these officials is publicly available through resources like the UT County Technical Assistance Service (CTAS) and municipal websites.25

## **IV. The Strategic Marketing and Engagement Plan (Zero-Budget Framework)**

By focusing on four core initiatives, the Center can execute the cores in parallel with no direct marketing budget by leveraging existing university resources and my time.

### **A. Initiative 1: Foundational Asset Development**

The GIS Center must present a professional and compelling image to compete effectively. The reimaging of the Center requires a suite of standardized marketing materials. The "no budget" constraint can be overcome by collaborating with APSU's internal Office of Public Relations & Marketing, which employs a whole staff of design, writing, and branding professionals.35 This partnership provides access to thousands of dollars in professional services at no direct cost to the Center.

**Action Steps:**

1. **Engage APSU Public Relations & Marketing:** Formally request collaboration to develop a consistent brand identity for the GIS Center that aligns with university standards.36  
2. **Develop a "One-Pager" for Stormwater Solutions:** Create a single, visually compelling PDF document that explicitly addresses municipal stormwater management challenges and highlights the Center's capabilities in utility mapping, modeling, and NPDES compliance support. The one-pager becomes a targeted tool for a known, high-value pain point.  
3. **Produce Professional Case Studies:** Select two of the Center's most successful past projects (e.g., the Wetlands Project).22 Work with the APSU University Editor/Writer to draft them in a "Challenge-Solution-Result" format, including client testimonials if possible.  
4. **Create a Standardized Capabilities Deck:** Use official APSU brand templates to create a 10-12 slide presentation covering the Center's mission, the geospatial advantage, core services, case studies, and contact information. The deck will be the standard leave-behind for all meetings.

### **B. Initiative 2: Proactive Relationship-Based Outreach**

This initiative aims to systematically build relationships with key decision-makers in Tier 1 and Tier 2 jurisdictions, transforming cold contacts into warm leads. My status as a university professional, rather than a private-sector salesperson, is a key advantage. A call from the Director of a GIS Center at a state university is a peer-to-peer conversation, not a sales pitch, dramatically increasing the likelihood of securing a meeting.

**Action Steps:**

1. **Execute a "Top 20" Contact Campaign:** Using the Key Personnel Directory, the Director will personally reach out to the top 20 individuals on the prioritized list.  
2. **Initial Email Outreach:** Draft a concise, personalized email. The subject line should be direct: *"GIS Expertise from Austin Peay for \[Jurisdiction Name\]"*. The body should reference a specific, known project or challenge (e.g., *"I was reading about your new comprehensive plan..."*) and offer expertise, not a sale. The relevant one-pager should be attached.  
3. **Follow-Up Phone Call:** Place a follow-up call one week after the email. The goal is to secure a 15-20 minute informational meeting. The script should emphasize the university partnership angle: *"As a fellow public service entity in the region, we wanted to introduce our Center's resources..."*  
4. **The Informational Meeting:** The first meeting is for discovery. Before presenting the Center's capabilities, my staff and I should listen to the municipality's challenges, current GIS use, and upcoming projects. The objective is to identify a specific, solvable problem that can serve as an entry point for a larger relationship.

### **C. Initiative 3: The Authority and Visibility Campaign**

A one-person marketing effort cannot rely solely on one-to-one meetings. This initiative focuses on one-to-many communication to establish the APSU GIS Center as the go-to regional authority on municipal GIS applications, which will generate inbound leads and build brand equity.

**Action Steps:**

1. **Targeted Conference Presentations:** I will proactively seek speaking opportunities at the annual conferences of key professional organizations. These venues bring together the Center's entire target audience in one place. Key targets include:  
   * Tennessee Municipal League (TML) Annual Conference 37  
   * Kentucky League of Cities (KLC) Conference & Expo 39  
   * TN Chapter of the American Public Works Association (TCAPWA) Conference 41  
   * KY Chapter of the American Public Works Association (APWA) Conference 43

     Presentation topics should be educational and non-commercial, addressing real-world municipal problems, such as "Beyond the Map: Using GIS to Justify Your Stormwater Utility Fee" or "Low-Cost, High-Impact: Building a Municipal Asset Inventory with University Partners."  
2. **Author Articles for Trade Publications:** The content from these presentations can be repurposed into 750-1,000 word articles for trade publications that local officials read. Key outlets include TML's Tennessee Town and City newspaper, KLC's Kentucky City magazine, and the Kentucky Association of Counties' County Line magazine.45 An article provides lasting visibility and can be used as a marketing asset.  
3. **Host Annual Webinars:** The Center can host regular educational webinars on high-interest topics using university resources and marketing channels. Requiring registration allows the Center to capture contact information from interested municipal officials, building a valuable mailing list for future outreach.

### **D. Initiative 4: The University Geospatial Advantage Initiative**

This initiative weaponizes the Center's academic status to create unique, low-risk entry points for new municipal clients, bridging the gap between its educational mission and business development goals.

**Action Steps:**

1. **Formalize a "GIS Municipal Internship Program":** Develop a program where a municipality can sponsor a student intern for a semester to work on a specific, well-defined project (e.g., digitizing paper utility maps, field-verifying fire hydrant locations). The municipality investment is minimal (a student stipend), but the lead is high and establishes a work relationship with the Center.  
2. **Develop a "GIS Needs Assessment" Capstone Project:** Create a project template for graduate students to conduct a comprehensive GIS Needs Assessment for a local government partner. The assessment would involve interviewing department heads, inventorying existing data, and producing a final report with a strategic roadmap for GIS implementation. The assessment service can be offered at a very low cost as a "loss leader," because the final report is a detailed scope of work for a future, fully-funded contract with the GIS Center. This strategy creates a self-perpetuating cycle: the Center provides educational opportunities, generates detailed project scopes and strong client relationships, and leads directly to funded contracts. It makes a competitive moat that private firms cannot cross.

**E. Initiative 5: The Economic Development and Data Analytics Service Line**

This initiative leverages the Center's access to Esri's Business Analyst software to create a new, high-value service line focused on economic development and community planning. This expands the Center's value proposition beyond infrastructure and positions it as a strategic partner in a municipality's growth. Since the Center already has access to the software, the entire initiative can be developed with no additional budget, but it will require employee person-hours.

**Action Steps:**

1. **Develop a "Community Snapshot" Package:** Using Business Analyst's infographic templates, create a standardized, visually compelling one-page "Community Snapshot" report. This report will highlight key demographic trends, consumer spending data, and market potential for a target jurisdiction. This package will be a powerful, low-cost "foot-in-the-door" marketing tool.  
2. **Target Economic Development and Planning Departments:** Contact economic development directors and planning departments in Tier 1 jurisdictions. Offer to produce a complimentary "Community Snapshot" to demonstrate the Center's capabilities and open a dialogue about their specific data needs for business recruitment, site suitability analysis, and retention efforts.  
3. **Offer Grant Writing Support Services:** Market a "Grant Support Package" to local governments. Use Business Analyst to generate the authoritative demographic, socioeconomic, and housing data required for competitive state and federal grant applications. This service addresses a critical need for smaller municipalities with limited in-house research staff.    
4. **Integrate Business Analyst into Student Projects:** Incorporate Business Analyst into the "University Advantage Initiative." Train student interns and those in capstone courses on the software, allowing them to assist in generating market reports and community analyses. The work gives students highly marketable data analytics skills while delivering a cost-effective service to municipal partners.  

**F. Initiative 6: The Public Safety and Facility Resilience Initiative**

This initiative consolidates the Center's most unique and time-tested capabilities: UAV data collection, disaster response, and BIM/facilities mapping. The goal is to formalize these services and proactively market them as an integrated public safety solution. This positions the Center as an essential partner in community resilience, covering the entire emergency management cycle from pre-incident planning to post-disaster recovery.

**Action Steps:**

1. **Develop an Integrated "Public Safety & Resilience" One-Pager:** Create a targeted document for EMA directors, mayors, police/fire chiefs, and public works directors. This document will highlight the Center's full capabilities: 1\) Pre-incident planning using 360-degree cameras and BIM to create digital twins of critical facilities (schools, courthouses) for tactical response and preventive maintenance. 2\) Post-disaster response using UAVs for rapid damage assessment and debris estimation. The one-pager will feature past successes to establish credibility.    
2. **Proactive Outreach to Public Safety and Facilities Leaders:** The Director will conduct targeted outreach to EMA directors and facility managers in all Tier 1 and Tier 2 counties. The goal is establishing pre-event relationships and Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs). The pitch is to integrate the GIS Center into their existing emergency response and capital improvement plans as a pre-vetted, expert asset for digital facility management and aerial intelligence.  
3. **Create a "Safer Facilities" Case Study:** Leveraging the initial APSU facilities mapping project, work with the university's marketing office to develop a case study focused on the benefits of facility management and first responder preparedness. This narrative will serve as powerful marketing content for the website and outreach efforts.    
4. **Host a "GIS for Public Safety & Facilities" Workshop:** Offer a free, half-day workshop for local EMA, fire, police, and public works departments. The workshop will demonstrate the utility of an interactive 3D map of a building in an emergency simulation and how UAV data can guide recovery. This educational event builds goodwill and showcases the practical, life-saving applications of the Center's services.  
 


## **V. Implementation Roadmap and Performance Measurement**

A clear, time-bound action plan with measurable indicators is crucial for ensuring progress and demonstrating success.

Secure the first paid economic development analysis project. Host "GIS for Public Safety & Facilities" workshop.. |

### **B. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Tracking**

T**B. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Tracking: A GIS-Centric Approach**

To measure the effectiveness of this plan, the Center must track metrics that correlate directly to increasing revenue. While a simple spreadsheet could suffice, a far more strategic and brand-aligned approach is to leverage the Center's core competencies by using an Esri solution, such as the ArcGIS Performance Management solution. This practice of "eating your own dog food" transforms a simple administrative task into a powerful, multi-faceted marketing tool.

Adopting a GIS-centric tracking system offers several distinct advantages:

* **Live Demonstration of Capability:** Using a dynamic Esri dashboard to monitor marketing KPIs is a compelling demonstration for potential clients. It showcases how GIS can be applied to strategic management, not just mapping physical assets, reinforcing the Center's expertise.  
* **Reinforces Brand Identity:** It positions the Center as a sophisticated, high-level GIS authority that integrates its technology into its core business processes, a practice that aligns with advanced private-sector competitors.    
* **Creates a "Living" Case Study:** The performance dashboard itself becomes a tangible case study, illustrating the versatility of GIS for non-traditional applications like business development.  
* **Integrates with the University Mission:** The development and maintenance of the dashboard can be incorporated into the "University Advantage Initiative," providing students with invaluable, real-world experience in applying GIS to strategic challenges.  

The following KPIs will be tracked within this system:

**Leading Indicators (Activity & Engagement Metrics):**

* Number of outreach contacts made (emails/calls)  
* Number of informational meetings secured  
* Number of conference/article submissions and acceptances  
* Number of webinar/event attendees and leads generated

**Lagging Indicators (Business & Revenue Metrics):**

* Number of proposals/quotes submitted  
* Total value of submitted proposals ($)  
* Number of contracts won (win rate)  
* Total value of new contracts ($)  
* Total revenue generated from new municipal contracts

Tracking leading and lagging indicators within a GIS dashboard allows the Director to manage the business development process like a sales funnel. For example, if the number of "Proposals Submitted" is low, the root cause might be an insufficient number of "Meetings Secured," indicating a need to adjust the outreach strategy. This data-driven, GIS-centric approach not only transforms marketing into a measurable process but also provides clear evidence of what is working, justifies future resource requests, and actively serves as a marketing asset in its own right.

## **Conclusion and Recommendations**

The Austin Peay State University GIS Center faces a significant opportunity to expand its revenue base and regional impact by systematically targeting local government contracts. The market is defined by a clear, non-discretionary need for the Center's core services, driven by regulatory mandates in stormwater management and the ongoing infrastructure planning and development cycle. While the competitive landscape includes established private firms, the Center possesses a unique and powerful set of differentiators rooted in its identity as a public university.

The Center can effectively leverage these advantages by implementing the zero-budget, four-pronged marketing strategy detailed in this report. The core recommendations are as follows:

1. **Immediately forge a partnership with the APSU Office of Public Relations & Marketing** to develop professional-grade marketing assets at no direct cost.  
2. **Adopt a disciplined, relationship-based outreach strategy** focused on a prioritized list of Tier 1 and Tier 2 municipalities, using the Center's and my status as an academic peer to open doors.  
3. **Commit to the Authority & Visibility Campaign** by consistently submitting presentation proposals to key municipal and public works conferences and authoring articles for their trade publications. This one-to-many approach offers the highest return on the Director's time.  
4. **Operationalize the University Geospatial Advantage** by creating formal internship and capstone project programs that serve as low-risk, high-value entry points for new municipal clients.  
5. **Launch the Economic Development and Data Analytics Service Line** by leveraging the existing Esri Business Analyst software to provide high-value market analysis, grant support, and community planning services, opening a new revenue stream and elevating the Center's role to that of a strategic partner.  
6. **Formalize and market the Center's full public safety capabilities** by creating the Public Safety and Facility Resilience Initiative. This combines the proven disaster response services with the new BIM and digital twin capabilities, offering an integrated solution for pre-incident planning, facility management, and post-event recovery.

   This plan is not a plan to compete with private firms on their terms. It is a plan to change the terms of the competition. By positioning itself as a credible, cost-effective, and community-focused academic partner, the APSU GIS Center can build a sustainable and growing revenue stream that simultaneously fulfills its public service and educational missions.
